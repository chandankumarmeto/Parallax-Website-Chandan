                    ‟Hope” is the thing with feathers –<br>
                    That perches in the soul –<br>
                    And sings the tune without the words –<br>
                    And never stops – at all –<br>
                    And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –<br>
                    And sore must be the storm –<br>
                    That could abash the little Bird<br>
                    That kept so many warm –<br>
                    I’ve heard it in the chillest land –<br>
                    And on the strangest Sea –<br>
                    Yet – never – in Extremity,<br>
                    It asked a crumb – of me.
